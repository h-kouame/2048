# 2048
Using various Machine Learning / AI Algorithms to solve the game 2048. Still a work in progress.  

# Run Command
>> python 2048.py [agent] [seed] [delay]

agent = {human, nn, svm, prior, random}

seed = random generator seed for reproductibility

delay = delay in seconds between the steps of the game, used to control the speed of execution of the ML agents
